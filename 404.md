<h2>Title: Finals HDFS</h2>
 
<h4>Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)</h4> 

<br>1) HDFS - since hardware failure is common in huge distributions, HDFS focuses on detection of faults beforehand, as well as quick and automatic recovery of fail time is HDFS main goal.

<br>2) HDFS - High Throughput on lowcost machines, can transfer tons and tons of files on a single instance

<br>3) HDFS - running applications in HDFS are huge, Terabyte is a common file size in HDFS. Therefore high aggregate data bandwidth and large scale of nodes in a single cluster is needed on each instance.

<br>4) HDFS has MapReduce application to refrain from data coherency issues when transferring huge data.

<br>5) With huge data transfers in mind, moving the computation is a lot more efficient than moving the actual data, computation is more efficient if it is nearer the data it operates on.

<br>6) Regarding its architecture, HDFS has Master/ Slave architecture. 

<br>7) HDFS cluster has a single NameNode, this is the MASTER in the architecture that manages file system namespace and regulates access to files by clients.

<br>8) NameNode opens, closes, rename files and rename directories. It is responsible for mapping / assigning blocks to DataNodes.

<br>9) DataNode holds one or more BLOCKS. A File is split into one or several BLOCKS. 

<br>10) DataNode receives read and write requests directly from client. With instructions coming from Namenode, DataNode also performs block creation, deletion, and replication.
